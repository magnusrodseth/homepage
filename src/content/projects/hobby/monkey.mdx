## Why?

Spring 2023, I attended a class called [Compiler Construction](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TDT4205) at my university, NTNU. There, I implemented a compiler for a hypothetical language called VSL, "Very Simple Language". For details regarding the project, please [read more about VSL here](/projects/school/vsl-compiler).

During that class, I barely understood anything of what was going on. So, I decided to read up on the subject, and found the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). I decided to implement the Monkey programming language, as described in the book, in Rust.

## Why the name "Monkey"?

As stated in Thorsten Ball's "Writing an Interpreter in Go":

> But why the name? Why is it called “Monkey”? Well, because monkeys are magnificent, elegant, fascinating and funny creatures. Exactly like our interpreter.

## Journal of the journey

I wrote a comprehensive journal, or set of notes, while working on this project. You can read more about it on [GitHub](https://github.com/magnusrodseth/monkey).
