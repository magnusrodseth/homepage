## Why the name Celeritas?

Visit the website [here](https://celeritas.vercel.app/) to find out!

## Why did I make this?

I made this website during the time I took the _Data structures and algorithms_ course at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/).

I wanted to have a place where I could visualize the data structures and algorithms I learned about in the course. I also wanted to have a place where I could write about the algorithms and data structures I learned about.

It was a way for me to put theory in practice, visualizing various sorting algorithms, graph algorithms and pathfinding algorithms.

## Some videos of the website in action

_In the video above, you can see a visualization of the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm. The random maze generation is recursive, and guarantees one path from start node to target node._
