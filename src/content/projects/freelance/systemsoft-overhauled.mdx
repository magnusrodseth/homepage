## Why?

If you haven't skimmed through [the original SystemSoft project](/projects/freelance/systemsoft), I recommend you do so. It will provide a lot of context for this post.

I came to realize that Vercel allows you to host websites for free, and the [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) content management system is also free for small projects.

Combining these two, there is no need for a self-hosted database, nor a virtual machine to host the website or the content management system. This means that the yearly cost of hosting the website is $0, apart from the domain costs.

## Choosing the technology stack

I decided to keep [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the web framework, as it is a great tool for building full-stack websites.

I moved from Tailwind CSS to [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), as I wanted to try out these new tools. In genereal, I'm very happy with the developer experience using Stitches and Radix, but as the project grew, the TypeScript auto-complete started lagging a bit. In particular, I learnt a lot from Radix's documentation, specifically their ["Composing a palette"](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/composing-a-palette) and ["Understanding the palette"](https://www.radix-ui.com/docs/colors/palette-composition/understanding-the-scale) section.

I moved from Strapi to Sanity, due to the cost reduction.

I also moved from DigitalOcean to Vercel, also due to the cost reduction.

## The overhaul process

As a I was not happy with the finished frontend design of the original SystemSoft project, I decided to start from scratch. I found it just as easy to create a brand color palette using Stitches + Radix, as it was to use Tailwind CSS.

Additionally, I created a simplistic logo using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and exported it as an SVG file.

There was no big changes in the actual content in the content management system. Hence, converting the schemas and models was a breeze. Deploying to Sanity is also extremely easy, as it is a hosted service. To ensure auto-generated type safety of their models in my Next.js client, I used the [Sanity GraphQL](https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql) API with [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/).

Deploying to Vercel is almost _too_ easy. I just had to connect my GitHub repository to Vercel, and it automatically deploys the website on every push to the `main` branch.

Moving the domain name servers from DigitalOcean to Vercel was also a breeze. I just had to change the nameservers in the domain registrar, and click a button in the Vercel dashboard. _Nice_.

## The result (and the cost reduction ðŸ’¸)

The finished result can be seen at [systemsoft.no](https://systemsoft.no). The yearly cost of hosting the website is now $0, apart from the domain costs. That is $300 USD less than the original SystemSoft project.
