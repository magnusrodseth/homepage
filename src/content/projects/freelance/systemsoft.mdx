## What is SystemSoft?

SystemSoft is a software engineering company that specializes in low-level software development. They are based in Norway, and have worked with big clients such as [Kongsberg](https://www.kongsberg.com/).

Together with one co-developer, we built a portfolio website for SystemSoft. The website allows employees of SystemSoft to access a content management system in order to efficiently, independently, and
continuously update the company's portfolio.

When we first developed this project, we used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the frontend, and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) for the backend. We deployed the project on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize the project.

I say _first_, because I later decided to completely overhaul their website, building it from scratch. Read about that process [here](/portfolio/freelance/systemsoft-overhauled). Visit their current website [here](https://systemsoft.no/).

## What I learned

I had a lot of experience using Next.js and Tailwind, but I had only prototyped using Strapi before. This was my first time using Strapi in a production environment, and I learned a lot about how to use it effectively.

Furthermore, I learned a lot about servers, the cloud, and "living in the terminal" whilst deploying the project on DigitalOcean. I also learned a lot about Docker, and how to use it to containerize a project.

## What I would do differently

Seeing as I ended up completely overhauling the website, I would do a lot of things differently.

Read more about that process, and what I learnt from it, [here](/projects/freelance/systemsoft-overhauled).
