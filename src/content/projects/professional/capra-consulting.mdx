## The project

The summer internship team that I was part of was tasked with creating an advisor for [Dr. Dropin](https://www.drdropin.no/), a health platform that connects users with therapists. The advisor was to be a web application that would recommend the proper consultation and therapist based on a user's answers to a questionnaire.

By the end of the October of 2022, the advisor had 1500+ monthly users.

## The tech

The advisor was built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) was used as a content management system for keeping information about the therapists' competencies and expertises. The advisor was also containerized with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and tested with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## The team

The team consisted of a total of 7 people, including myself. We were 5 main developers, one team lead, and one project manager responsible for the main client communication. Throughout the summer, all developers worked across the stack.

## The process

The project was divided into 3 sprints, each lasting 2 weeks. The first sprint was spent on creating the initial project structure and mapping out the application flow. The second sprint was spent on implementing the questionnaire and setting up Sanity. The third sprint was spent on recommending the correct therapist, adding the final touches and monitoring using Google Analytics.
