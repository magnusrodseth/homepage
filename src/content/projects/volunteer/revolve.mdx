## What is Revolve NTNU?

Revolve NTNU is a volunteer organization at NTNU, building an autonomous and electric racecar for the yearly international Formula Student competition. The competition is a great opportunity to learn about engineering, teamwork, and project management.

## My contributions

In general, I provided technical solutions to electrical and mechanical engineers whilst working in a team, providing a great opportunity to seek valuable and constructive feedback from my peers.

I was part of the software team. The software team is responsible for all software used by other teams when creating the car.

My main contributions were two-fold:

### Revolve Analyze

Analyze is a C# desktop application for analyzing both live data and post-processing data from the racecar.

### Revolve Aerolyze

Aerolyze is a full-stack web application for analyzing aerodynamic data from the racecar. It allows the Aerodynamics team to analyze the data by "slicing" the car in many pieces, and make decisions on how to improve the car.

It is built using Next.js, React, Redux, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and hosted on Azure.

## What I learned

Throughout my year in Revolve NTNU, I learned a lot about engineering, teamwork, and project management. I also learned a lot about software development, and how to work in a team. After all, this was my very first time building a full-stack web application, let alone work in a team.

I learnt about the importance of communication, and how to communicate effectively. I also learnt about the importance of documentation, and how to document my work.

Furthermore, I learnt about agile development, and how to work in an agile team.
