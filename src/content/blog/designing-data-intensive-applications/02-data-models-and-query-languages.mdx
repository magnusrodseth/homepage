## Introduction

Data models are perhaps the most important part of developing software, because they have such a
profound effect: not only on how the software is written, but also on how we think about the problem
that we are solving.

In a complex application there may be more intermediary levels, such as APIs built upon APIs, but
the basic idea is still the same: each layer hides the complexity of the layers below it by
providing a clean data model. These abstractions allow different groups of people—for example,
the engineers at the database vendor and the application developers using their database—to work
together effectively.

## Relational Model Versus Document Model

By the mid-1980s, relational database management systems
(RDBMSes) and SQL had become the tools of choice for most people who needed to store and query data
with some kind of regular structure.

As computers became vastly more powerful and networked, they started being used for increasingly
diverse purposes. And remarkably, relational databases turned out to generalize very well, beyond
their original scope of business data processing, to a broad variety of use cases. Much of what you
see on the web today is still powered by relational databases, be it online publishing,
discussion, social networking, ecommerce, games, software-as-a-service productivity applications,
or much more.

## The Birth of NoSQL

Now, in the 2010s, NoSQL is the latest attempt to overthrow the relational model's dominance. The
name “NoSQL” is unfortunate, since it doesn't actually refer to any particular technology. Nevertheless, the term struck a nerve and quickly spread through the
web startup community and beyond.

There are several driving forces behind the adoption of NoSQL databases, including:

- A need for greater scalability than relational databases can easily achieve, including very large
datasets or very high write throughput.

- A widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial database products.

- Specialized query operations that are not well supported by the relational model.

- Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas, and a desire for a more dynamic and
expressive data.

## The Object-Relational Mismatch

Most application development today is done in object-oriented programming languages, which leads to
a common criticism of the SQL data model: if data is stored in relational tables, an awkward
translation layer is required between the objects in the application code and the database model of
tables, rows, and columns.

Object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks reduce the amount of
boilerplate code required for this translation layer, but they can't completely hide the differences
between the two models.

Some developers feel that the JSON model reduces the impedance mismatch between the application code
and the storage layer. However, the lack of a schema is often cited as an advantage.

The JSON representation has better locality than the multi-table schema. If you want to fetch a profile in the relational example, you need to
either perform multiple queries (query each table by `user_id`) or perform a messy multi-way join
between the users table and its subordinate tables. In the JSON representation, all the relevant
information is in one place, and one query is sufficient.

## Many-to-one and Many-to-many Relationships

In relational databases, it's normal to refer to rows in other tables by ID, because
joins are easy. In document databases, joins are not needed for one-to-many tree structures, and
support for joins is often weak.

## Are Document Databases Repeating History?

While many-to-many relationships and joins are routinely used in relational databases, document
databases and NoSQL reopened the debate on how best to represent such relationships in a database.
This debate is much older than NoSQL—in fact, it goes back to the very earliest computerized
database systems

### The relational model

What the relational model did was to lay out all the data in the open: a relation
(table) is simply a collection of tuples (rows), and that's it.

If you want to query your data in new ways, you can just declare a new index, and queries will
automatically use whichever indexes are most appropriate. You don't need to change your queries to
take advantage of a new index.

A key insight of the relational model was this: you only need to build a query optimizer once,
and then all applications that use the database can benefit from it. If you don't have a query
optimizer, it's easier to handcode the access paths for a particular query than to write a
general-purpose optimizer—but the general-purpose solution wins in the long run.

### Relational Versus Document Databases Today

There are many differences to consider when comparing relational databases to document databases. The main arguments in favor of the document data model are schema flexibility, better performance
due to locality, and that for some applications it is closer to the data structures used by the
application. The relational model counters by providing better support for joins, and many-to-one
and many-to-many relationships.

### Which data model leads to simpler application code?

The document model has limitations: for example, you cannot refer directly to a nested item
within a document, but instead you need to say something like “the second item in the list of
positions for user 251” (much like an access path in the hierarchical model). However, as long as
documents are not too deeply nested, that is not usually a problem.

However, if your application does use many-to-many relationships, the document model becomes less
appealing. It's possible to reduce the need for joins by denormalizing, but then the application
code needs to do additional work to keep the denormalized data consistent. Joins can be emulated in
application code by making multiple requests to the database, but that also moves complexity into
the application and is usually slower than a join performed by specialized code inside the
database. In such cases, using a document model can lead to significantly more complex application
code and worse performance.

<Callout>
  In my personal experience, the above-mentioned approach is a headache to maintain. 
  Manually worrying about joins is cumbersome and not really performant. 
  In this case, one would be better of using a relational approach.
</Callout>

It's not possible to say in general which data model leads to simpler application code; it depends
on the kinds of relationships that exist between data items. For highly interconnected data, the
document model is awkward, the relational model is acceptable, and graph models are the most natural.

### Schema flexibility in the document model

No schema means that arbitrary keys and values can be added to a document, and when
reading, clients have no guarantees as to what fields the documents may contain.

<Callout>
  Note that if one goes for this approach **and wants type safety in the application** (which you should),
  the consumer of the database must administer the types themselves.

  There is also no guarantee that the data is consistent.
</Callout>

Schema-on-read is similar to dynamic (runtime) type checking in programming languages, whereas
schema-on-write is similar to static (compile-time) type checking.

The difference between the approaches is particularly noticeable in situations where an application
wants to change the format of its data. For example, say you are currently storing each user's full
name in one field, and you instead want to store the first name and last name separately.
In a document database, you would just start writing new documents with the new fields and have
code in the application that handles the case when old documents are read. For example:

```js
if (user && user.name && !user.first_name) {
    // Documents written before Dec 8, 2013 don't have first_name
    user.first_name = user.name.split(" ")[0];
}
```

On the other hand, in a “statically typed” database schema, you would typically perform a
migration along the lines of:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN first_name text;
UPDATE users SET first_name = split_part(name, ' ', 1);
```

Schema changes have a bad reputation of being slow and requiring downtime. This reputation is not
entirely deserved: most relational database systems execute the ALTER TABLE statement in a few
milliseconds. MySQL is a notable exception—it copies the entire table on ALTER TABLE, which
can mean minutes or even hours of downtime when altering a large table.

However, in cases where all records are expected to have the same
structure, schemas are a useful mechanism for documenting and enforcing that structure.

### Data locality for queries

The locality advantage only applies if you need large parts of the document at the same time. The
database typically needs to load the entire document, even if you access only a small portion of it,
which can be wasteful on large documents.

### Convergence of document and relational databases

It seems that relational and document databases are becoming more similar over time, and that is a
good thing: the data models complement each
other. If a database is able to handle document-like data and also perform
relational queries on it, applications can use the combination of features that best fits their
needs.

## Query Languages for Data

In a declarative query language, like SQL or relational algebra, you just specify the pattern of the
data you want—what conditions the results must meet, and how you want the data to be transformed (e.g.,
sorted, grouped, and aggregated)—but not how to achieve that goal. It is up to the database
system's query optimizer to decide which indexes and which join methods to use, and in which order
to execute various parts of the query.

A declarative query language is attractive because it is typically more concise and easier to work
with than an imperative API. But more importantly, it also hides implementation details of the
database engine, which makes it possible for the database system to introduce performance
improvements without requiring any changes to queries.

The fact that SQL is more limited in functionality gives the
database much more room for automatic optimizations.

Finally, declarative languages often lend themselves to parallel execution. Declarative languages have a
better chance of getting faster in parallel execution because they specify only the pattern of the
results, not the algorithm that is used to determine the results. The database is free to use a
parallel implementation of the query language, if appropriate.

## Graph-Like Data Models

What if many-to-many relationships are very common in your data? The relational model can handle
simple cases of many-to-many relationships, but as the connections within your data become more
complex, it becomes more natural to start modeling your data as a graph.

A graph consists of two kinds of objects: vertices (also known as nodes or entities) and
edges (also known as relationships or arcs). Many kinds of data can be modeled as a graph.
Typical examples include:

- **Social graphs**. Vertices are people, and edges indicate which people know each other.

- **The web graph**. Vertices are web pages, and edges indicate HTML links to other pages.

- **Road or rail networks**. Vertices are junctions, and edges represent the roads or railway lines

Well-known algorithms can operate on these graphs: for example, car navigation systems search for
the shortest path between two points in a road network.

An equally powerful use of graphs is to provide a consistent way of storing completely different
types of objects in a single datastore. For example, Facebook maintains a single graph with many
different types of vertices and edges: vertices represent people, locations, events, checkins, and
comments made by users; edges indicate which people are friends with each other, which checkin
happened in which location, who commented on which post, who attended which event, and so on.

## Property Graphs

In the property graph model, each vertex consists of:

- A unique identifier

- A set of outgoing edges

- A set of incoming edges

- A collection of properties (key-value pairs)

Each edge consists of:

- A unique identifier

- The vertex at which the edge starts

- The vertex at which the edge ends

- A label to describe the kind of relationship between the two vertices

- A collection of properties (key-value pairs)

Some important aspects of this model are:

1. **Any vertex can have an edge connecting it with any other vertex**. There is no schema that
restricts which kinds of things can or cannot be associated.

2. **Given any vertex, you can efficiently find both its incoming and its outgoing edges, and thus
traverse the graph**. For instance, you can follow a path through a chain of vertices—both forward and backward.

3. **By using different labels for different kinds of relationships, you can store several different
kinds of information in a single graph, while still maintaining a clean data model**.

<Callout>
  Graphs are good for evolvability: as you add features to your application, a graph can easily be
  extended to accommodate changes in your application's data structures.
</Callout>

## Graph Queries in SQL

In a relational database, you usually know in advance
which joins you need in your query. In a graph query, you may need to traverse a variable number of
edges before you find the vertex you're looking for—that is, the number of joins is not fixed in
advance.

If the same query can be written in 4 lines in one query language (graph) but requires 29 lines in
another (relational), that just shows that different data models are designed to satisfy different use cases.
It's important to pick a data model that is suitable for your application.

## Summary

Historically, data started out being represented as one big tree (the hierarchical model), but that
wasn't good for representing many-to-many relationships, so the relational model was invented to
solve that problem. More recently, developers found that some applications don't fit well in the
relational model either. New nonrelational “NoSQL” datastores have diverged in two main
directions:

1. **Document databases** target use cases where data comes in self-contained documents and
relationships between one document and another are rare.

2. **Graph databases** go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially
related to everything.

All three models (document, relational, and graph) are widely used today, and each is good in its
respective domain. That's why we have
different systems for different purposes, not a single one-size-fits-all solution.

One thing that document and graph databases have in common is that they typically don't enforce a
schema for the data they store, which can make it easier to adapt applications to changing
requirements. However, your application most likely still assumes that data has a certain structure;
it's just a question of whether the schema is explicit (enforced on write) or implicit (handled on
read).
