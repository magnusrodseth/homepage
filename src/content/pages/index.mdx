Hey! I'm Magnus Rodseth, a developer who spends an unreasonable amount of time teaching AI agents to do his job—only to spend even more time reviewing their work.

Currently working as a Full-stack Developer at [Capra Consulting](https://capraconsulting.no/), delivering software solutions for enterprise clients. I also serve as a Board Member at [Junior Consulting](https://www.juniorconsulting.no/), where I previously held the position of Partner and Head of Technology.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/), specializing in Software Systems.

Outside of programming, I enjoy hanging out with friends, exercising, and watching movies. You can find a [list of all my projects here](/projects).
