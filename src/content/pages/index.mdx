Hey! I am Magnus RÃ¸dseth, a developer deeply committed to crafting high-quality, performant solutions.

Currently working as a team lead and software developer at [Junior Consulting](https://www.jrc.no/), Scandinavia's largest student-led consulting firm.

Student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/), where I am pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science.

Creating and bringing ideas to life is my passion. You can find a [list of all my projects here](/projects).

Outside of programming, I enjoy hanging out with friends, exercising, and watching movies.
